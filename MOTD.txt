<i>I just want to point out to people who want to make fan games of Capuchin. We are asking that you do not. The reason as to why we let Capulegacy do it is because the owner is a close friend of mine and if we want something changed and it can be done. There does not need to be more Capulegacy’s or Capuchin’s. Let the game rest, it needs it.

V2 will stay up for a while longer and I will warn everyone a month in advance before the servers go down. 

If you want to make something, be creative and have fun with it. Don’t just remake other peoples work.

If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask me here or through email (duttbust@gmail.com) and I’ll respond once I get the chance 

In other news, a now main project has began development and so far I have some very awesome plans for it and I am very excited to share it in the future. I will update people more as time goes on.</i>

<b>THIS MEANS THAT HORROR REMAKE WILL EITHER CEASE OPERATIONS OR TURN INTO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME. WE ARE SORRY FOR THIS.</b>

Thanks,
